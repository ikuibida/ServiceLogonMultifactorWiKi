There are three steps to be done: 

1. Create a Telegram bot and get its API key (BotId in the settings) (see clause 3.1.); 

2. Get the ChatId of users (see section 3.2.); Enter the received data into the Service.Config.xml file and put it either next to the service when installing using the InstallUtil.exe utility (see item 4.) or next to the installer when installing using the installer (see item 5.) ; 

3. The configuration file with the parameters, as in the examples, can be downloaded here Service.Config.xml or for Russian OS Service.Config_ru.xml (you must rename to Service.Config.xml). Do not forget to enter your parameters before starting the service. 

Configuration files containing parameters from samples of either russian or english OS in the Distr_MSI_EXE catalogue. In more detail regarding each parameter of configuration see section 3.3.

Don`t forget to set your parameters before launching the service.
